# statistical-learning

This repository collects selected assignments from my Statistical Learning course at Rutgers.  
All work was done in R using R Markdown and knitted to HTML.

Each folder is a self-contained assignment that focuses on a specific modeling idea.

## Contents

**model-selection-leaps-lars**  
Variable selection and regularization using best subsets, LASSO, and related methods.  
Compares different models and looks at how choices of variables affect performance.

**regression-smoothers**  
Nonlinear regression using smoothers (e.g., splines, LOESS).  
Explores how tuning parameters control flexibility and overfitting.

**double-bootstrap**  
Double bootstrap approach for uncertainty and interval estimation.  
Uses resampling to study the variability of estimates and compare interval methods.

**neural-net-noaa**  
Neural network model on NOAA climate-disaster data.  
Builds and evaluates a simple network, and compares it to more traditional models.

**multiple-testing-fdr**  
Multiple hypothesis testing and control of the False Discovery Rate.  
Applies procedures like Benjamini–Hochberg and examines which findings remain significant.

**mystery-modeling**  
End-to-end analysis of an unknown “mystery” dataset.  
Performs EDA, fits several candidate models, evaluates performance, and explains the final choice.

## Skills demonstrated

- R and R Markdown for reproducible analysis
- Model selection and regularization (leaps, LASSO/LARS-style ideas)
- Nonlinear modeling with smoothers
- Bootstrap and double bootstrap methods
- Multiple testing and FDR control
- Basic neural network modeling in R
- End-to-end workflow: EDA → model building → evaluation → interpretation
